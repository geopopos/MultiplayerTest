[x] update playerdetection on severside to hold a list of players in the bats playerdetection zone. From there calculate which player is closest and go after them

[] later add an agro calculator as well. bat will attack whoever caused the most agro

* fixed the below issue by having the player chase state check that the player still is in the player_collection_state
there is a slight bug in the enemy wander controller. If a player disconnects while being chased by the enemy, the body exited signal is never triggered. we will need to run a check to see if the character is still connected

there's something going on where the hurt animation is continuously playing. I believe it has something to do with the way we are calling hurt server side

got the player to reappear I accidentally turned off the sprites visibility.

Now when the player hurt animation starts it doesn't stop. I have a feeling, it is because the old player states are overwriting when I change the state back to idle
 - i updated the player to set it's anaimtion state
